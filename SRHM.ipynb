Also, we should take into consideration that there isn't signifacant change of score on train data, according to RMLSE metric. Thus, selection of parameters is the room for improvement. However, I want to explore more machine learning algorthms. Like I said, my main aim for this competition isn't rewards but obtaining initial expertise in learning process."

    "RandomForest looks like the most robust algorithm and this fact isn't seem strange. I suppose that we should use raw data (most features) to improve current results. Moreover, feature engineering is good room for improvement. But, I aslo want to involve k-nearest algoritm and only after that go on to the next stages (all features, feature engineering, reduce dimension methods, gbm)"
